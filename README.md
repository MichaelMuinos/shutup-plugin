# Shutup: A SourceMod Plugin
Allows players to be muted via text / voice by name with a specified time limit.
The punishments are carried out in real time, meaning once the player's punishment
time limit has expired, they will be unmuted/ungagged immediately.

## Installation
1) Run the init-sql script located at the path `sql-init/shutup.sql`. This is used to create the mute and gag list tables.
2) Add the entry titled `shutup_accounts` to `configs/databases.cfg`.
An example may look like...
```
"shutup_accounts"
	{
		"driver"			"mysql"
		"host"				"localhost"
		"database"		        "db_name"
		"user"				"username"
		"pass"				"password"
		"port"				"1234"
	}
```
3) Compile the plugin. To compile, you can use http://www.sourcemod.net/compiler.php. Simply choose the file `scripting/shutup.sp`.
4) Finally, download `shutup.smx` and place the compiled plugin into the destination `sourcemod/plugins`.
